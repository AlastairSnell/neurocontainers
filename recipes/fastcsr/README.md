## fastcsr/toolVersion ##
 Reconstructing cortical surfaces from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prerequisite for surface-based functional and anatomical image analyses. Conventional algorithms for cortical surface construction are computationally inefficient and typically take several hours for each subject, causing a bottleneck in applications when fast turnaround time is needed. To address this challenge, here we proposed a fast cortical surface reconstruction (FastCSR) pipeline based on deep machine learning. 

Example:
```
python3 pipeline.py --sd ./data --sid sub-001  --t1 ./data/sub-001.nii.gz
```
